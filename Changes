 - build specifies using latest version of Statistics::Data (0.08) to help solve dist issues for some platforms

0.11 2013-06
 - rewrite of dump() method to cope with stats that have list output (as for Statistics::Sequences::Vnomes/observed).
 - eval{} of methods called for stats_hash() or dump().

0.10 2013-05
 - All methods for data-handling (load, read, add, unload) expanded and inherited from Statistics::Data
 - Overhauled interface to the statistics and tests - using methods to get descriptives, etc. - see the PODs
 - Have to name the "stat" you want for any of these methods, as well as for the "test"
 - Sub-modules parcelled out to exist in the world by themselves
 - Statistics::Zed object is no longer cached.
 - NOT compatible with prior versions. All sub-modules (tests of Runs, Turns, Pot, etc.) rewritten to be compatible.

0.052 2010-09-30
 - Check that all options sent to <test> are valid ones
 - Improve croak message for valid Vnomes test
 - Values for the arguments 'tails' and 'ccorr' must be specified as arguments on each call - they are not cached

0.051 2010-09-13
 - Statistics::Zed object cached during <new> so can be used repeatedly and shared between sub-modules
 - Vnomes: computes z-value from psisquare's p-value and uses this in dumps (as do the other sub-modules)

0.050 2010-09-12
 - added sub-module Turns - test of turning-points as local peaks and troughs 
 - added binate method in main package
 - Vnomes: changed rounding to flooring for the NIST-prescribed limit of length

0.04x 2010-09 
 - added sub-module Vnomes - Good's serial test
 - clean-up dump sub: if text => 0 or undef, you get printed what's returned by the sub string 
 - cleaned-up generic <load> sub and associated private subs
 - deprecated calling a test just by its name, rather than hash-keying it as "what".
