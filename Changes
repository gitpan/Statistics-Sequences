Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::Sequences.

0.051 2010 Sept 13:
 + Statistics::Zed object cached during <new> so can be used repeatedly and shared between sub-modules
 + Vnomes: computes z-value from psisquare's p-value and uses this in dumps (as do the other sub-modules)

0.050 2010 Sept 12:
 + added sub-module Turns - test of turning-points as local peaks and troughs 
 + added binate method in main package
 + Vnomes: changed rounding to flooring for the NIST-prescribed limit of length

0.04x 2010 Sept: 
 + added sub-module Vnomes - Good's serial test
 + clean-up dump sub: if text => 0 or undef, you get printed what's returned by the sub string 
 + cleaned-up generic <load> sub and associated private subs
 + deprecated calling a test just by its name, rather than hash-keying it as "what".
