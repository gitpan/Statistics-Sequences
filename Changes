Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::Sequences.

0.10 2013 May
 + All methods for data-handling (load, read, add, unload) expanded and inherited from Statistics::Data
 + Overhauled interface to the statistics and tests - using methods to get descriptives, etc. - see the PODs
 + Have to name the "stat" you want for any of these methods, as well as for the "test"
 + Sub-modules parcelled out to exist in the world by themselves
 + Statistics::Zed object is no longer cached.

0.052 2010 Sept 30
 + Check that all options sent to <test> are valid ones
 + Improve croak message for valid Vnomes test
 + Values for the arguments 'tails' and 'ccorr' must be specified as arguments on each call - they are not cached

0.051 2010 Sept 13:
 + Statistics::Zed object cached during <new> so can be used repeatedly and shared between sub-modules
 + Vnomes: computes z-value from psisquare's p-value and uses this in dumps (as do the other sub-modules)

0.050 2010 Sept 12:
 + added sub-module Turns - test of turning-points as local peaks and troughs 
 + added binate method in main package
 + Vnomes: changed rounding to flooring for the NIST-prescribed limit of length

0.04x 2010 Sept: 
 + added sub-module Vnomes - Good's serial test
 + clean-up dump sub: if text => 0 or undef, you get printed what's returned by the sub string 
 + cleaned-up generic <load> sub and associated private subs
 + deprecated calling a test just by its name, rather than hash-keying it as "what".
